This plugin converts a two-level menu to a conditional two-level menu.

== Description ==

A conditional two-level menu only shows the second level of the menu on relevant pages.

For example, if you had a menu that had a structure like so:

* Home
* About
 * History
 * People
* Contact
 * Mail
 * Phone
 * Email

You would only be able to see the "History" and "People" menu items on the "About," "History," and "People" pages.

The menu must be in the "Primary" location.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `two-level-conditional-menu.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
